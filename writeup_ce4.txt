I didn't add any extra or special features into my design, I just tried to make it follow exactly how a cassette player works. I made the buttons sound mechanical and had three unique sounds in total (one for Play, it should sound like you are putting the cassette tape in, one for Stop and Reset, this one should sound like a mechanical button being pressed down to stop / reset the tape, and one for rewind / fast forward, this should emulate the tape being sped up in the direction that the user wants it to go). Overall I created the different SamplePlayers for the different buttons, added them to the ac.out, and made each of them unique UI buttons. Then I made the endlistener to stop the music if it reaches the end, created logic for the playback rate, and logic for all of the buttons (Play, fastforward, stop, reset, and rewind).
